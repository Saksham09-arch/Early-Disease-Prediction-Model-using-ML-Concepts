A machine learning-based classification project designed to identify individuals at risk for heart disease, using health metrics and lifestyle data.

🔍 Project Overview:
- Predicts the likelihood of heart disease using key health indicators.
- Designed to assist early diagnosis and support preventive healthcare decisions.
- Based on a labeled dataset with features such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, smoking habits, and alcohol consumption.
  
🧪 Data Exploration & Preprocessing:
- Conducted full Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and correlations.
- Visualizations created to highlight relationships between health factors and disease presence.
- Handled missing values with appropriate imputation strategies.
- Normalized and standardized numeric features for optimal model performance.
- Encoded categorical variables to prepare the data for machine learning algorithms.
  
🤖 Model Development:
- Trained multiple classification models including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Split dataset into training and testing sets to avoid overfitting.
- Tuned hyperparameters for each model to enhance predictive accuracy and generalization.
  
📈 Model Evaluation:
- Evaluated using metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Compared models to balance interpretability and performance.
- Identified key predictors such as cholesterol level, age, and blood pressure.
💡 Insights & Outcomes:
